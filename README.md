This is a school homework project that demonstrates a simple web application built with Flask. The app retrieves and displays a random dad joke from an external API (icanhazdadjoke.com) using the requests module.
It features a homepage, a joke retrieval button, that fetches a random joke from the api and displays it on another page, as well as basic error handling in case of api response issues.
It uses Flask, the web framework for Python, and the requests modules to make http requests.
